**DDQN_PER.py** = double deep Q learning with prioratized experience replay

**DQN_PER.py** = deep Q learning with prioratized experienced replay

**dqn_agent.py** = deep Q learning with experience replay

**model.py** = Architecture of the neural network

**stock_trader_PER_trend.py** = stock trader with DQN and prioritized experienced replay

**stock_trader_trend_DDQN_PER.py** = stock trader with DDQN and prioritized experienced replay

**stock_trader_with_trend.py** = stock trader with DQN and experienced replay

# Introduction
Currently, I am working on **stock_trader_DDQN_PER.py** file. So, the results are shown using deep double Q learning with prioratized experience replay.
